# Downstragram [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rogeriopvl/downstagram.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rogeriopvl/downstagram)

## About

Downstagram is a simple command line tool to download and backup all your [Instagram][0] photos.

## Install

    npm install -g downstagram

## First run / OAuth Setup

After installation, Downstagram creates a configuration file in your home directory:

    ~/.downstagramrc

The file has the following fields and structure:

    {
        "auth": {
            "client_id": "xxx",
            "client_secret": "xxx",
            "access_token": "<will be set after oauth setup>"
        }
    }

On the first run, Downstagram runs the OAuth setup. The browser will open up with Instagram's authorization page. Just accept the authorization request and copy paste the resulting access token into the terminal window.

After this step, Downstagram is ready to backup your photos. Just run the command with your username and it's done.


### Usage

    downstagram [-m| --metadata] [-o| --output] <username>

        -o | --output <absolute-path>  (optional) Save media into a custom path (instead of the current dir)
        -m | --metadata                (optional) Also download a json file with all photo's metadata
        -v | --version      show Downstagram's version
        -h | --help         show help info
